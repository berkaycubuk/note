# Note
Note is a simple command line tool to quickly write down your ideas. I wroted it because pen & paper is sometimes away from me and I don't wanna lost my ideas :^)

## How it works
Note is just a simple bash script. It stores notes under `~/notes` folder and organizes files like `year/month/day` order. Notes does not create notes folder, you should create it. But other sub folders are created by Note. I use vim so when I create a new note it opens up the note for me. Oh, yeah notes are markdown and title and date frontmatters are insterted by default.

## Roadmap
[x] Create a new note in lowest possible effort
[ ] Easily access notes without going to the notes folder. Maybe opening the notes folder with vim works?
